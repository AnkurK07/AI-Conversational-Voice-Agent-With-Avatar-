  ## üß† Problem Statement
In an increasingly digital world, there is a growing demand for natural, human-like interactions between users and machines, especially in domains like education, healthcare, and customer service. Traditional text-based chatbots and voice assistants lack emotional engagement, real-time responsiveness, and visual personality failing to replicate the immersive experience of interacting with a real human.

The challenge lies in building a modular, intelligent, and lifelike AI system that can:

- Understand spoken input accurately in real-time.

- Generate context-aware, intelligent responses and can some work for you.

- Deliver replies through natural-sounding voice output.

- Display synchronized avatar animations to mimic human expressions.

- Orchestrate these components smoothly and scalably, with low latency and memory retention across turns.

This project aims to solve this challenge by creating an AI Conversational Voice Agent with Avatar, a multimodal system that enables real-time, interactive, speech-based conversations with a lifelike animated avatar.
